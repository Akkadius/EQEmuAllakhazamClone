# EQEmuAllakhazamClone

* This clone was originally created in 2004 by Muuss of our Emulator community, I've since gone through and cleaned quite a few things up but it still could use a complete rewrite as the internals are terrible to work with but this is an ancient PHP app and much has changed since
* If you are interested in using this for your server, it is plenty functional and below is the instructions to do so

### Setup

* Clone this repository into a webserver directory and then make a copy of the config file in `includes`

```cp includes/config.template.php includes/config.php```

* You will need to set your database variables and most importantly your site URL
